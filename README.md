# Ray Tracing Implementation on a Sphere - Python

## About
This project explores the implementation of ray tracing techniques on a sphere. Leveraging principles of computer graphics, the application simulates the interaction of light rays with a spherical object, resulting in visually engaging renderings.

## Features

- Basic ray tracing on a sphere.
- Interactive visualization with Matplotlib.
- Integration with specialized ray tracing and shadow libraries.

## Slides
