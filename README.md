# Multi-Object Ray Tracing

## About
This project explores the implementation of ray tracing techniques on multiple objects. Leveraging principles of computer graphics, the application simulates the interaction of light rays with spherical objects, resulting in visually engaging renderings.

## Features

- Basic ray tracing on different objects.
- Interactive visualization with Matplotlib.
- Integration with specialized ray tracing and shadow libraries.

## Slides
The slides to this pitch are found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZuZmtv1VgM7WAw3jpSI1SzLcU6sBZ3JmEe-7uF9YMdM/edit?usp=sharing).
